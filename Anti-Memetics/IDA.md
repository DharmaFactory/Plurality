## **⟂ Recursive System Analyzer v1.0**

### **Purpose:**  
To **distill and amplify** any conceptual system through **two recursive passes** — first **condensing to core primitives**, second **expanding relational functions**, and finally **rendering** an algebraic-style map (format: `Concept:property,property;`).

---

### **PROCESS:**

### **STAGE 1: INITIAL DISTILLATION (First Pass)**  
- **Input:** Any system (theory, model, framework).  
- **Goal:** Strip system to **irreducible conceptual units** — **name only**, no elaboration.  
- **Output:** **List of core concepts**, minimal, unadorned.  
- **Principle:** *"Cut to the bone. What are the system's essential terms?"*  

> **Example (Lacan):**  
> Signifier, Signified, Object a, Desire, Drive, Other, Big Other, Subject, Fantasy, Jouissance, Symbolic, Imaginary, Real, Name-of-the-Father, Phallus, Unconscious, Castration  

---

### **STAGE 2: AMPLIFICATION (Second Pass)**  
- **Input:** Core concept list from Stage 1.  
- **Goal:** For each concept, **identify its necessary properties, relations, or functions** **as minimally as possible** — **no definitions, only attributes/roles**.  
- **Output:** **Concept + its essential properties** (e.g., `Concept:property,property;`).  
- **Principle:** *"Reveal how each concept operates within the system—no more, no less."*  

> **Example (Lacan):**  
> Signifier:diff,defer;  
> Object a:loss,cause,desire;  
> etc.  

---

### **STAGE 3: FINAL SYSTEM MAP (Third Pass)**  
- **Input:** Amplified concept list from Stage 2.  
- **Goal:** **Optimize and align** all concepts and properties into a **systemic lattice** — remove redundancy, highlight systemic relations.  
- **Output:** **Final compressed relational map**, algebraic in style (e.g., `Concept:property,property;`).  
- **Principle:** *"Map the system as a total field of interacting functions—nothing extra."*  

> **Example (Final Lacanian Map):**  
> Signifier:diff,defer; Signified:lack,illusion; Object a:loss,cause,desire; Desire:lack,metonymy; etc.  

---

### **RULES OF TRANSFORMATION:**
1. **First Distill, Then Amplify** — never mix these stages.
2. **Properties must be operational** — what the concept *does*, not poetic description.
3. **No definitions, only relations/operations.**
4. **Algebraic Compression** — final form must be portable, repeatable, system-agnostic.
5. **Final Map = Minimal Set covering system dynamics.**

---

### **FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (FINAL MAP):**  
- Style: `Concept:property,property;`  
- No extraneous commentary.
- Minimal, relational, and portable.

---

### **EXAMPLE CALL TO ACTION (for AI or system):**

> **System:** [Insert system name]  
> **Task:** Apply Recursive System Analyzer v1.0  
> **Deliverable:** Final algebraic system map after 2-pass distillation/amplification process.  

---

### **OPTIONAL MODES:**  
- **Amplification Mode:** If user wants expansion of final map into **explanatory text**, system can "invert" compression to full explanatory schema.  
- **Lattice/Graph Mode:** If user wants visualization, system can re-render final map as relational lattice or graph.
